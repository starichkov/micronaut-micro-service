Micronaut microservice
=
This project is a Micronaut framework based, 'ready-to-play' micro-service with a simple UI for managing notes and tags.

## Features

- RESTful API for managing notes and tags
- Simple and responsive UI for creating, editing, and deleting notes and tags
- Ability to associate tags with notes for better organization
- Full-text search in notes (coming soon)

## Technical information

| Name       | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Java       | 21      |
| Maven      | 3.8.1+  |
| Micronaut  | 4.9.4   |
| PostgreSQL | 17.6    |

## Prerequisites

### Database Setup

The application requires a PostgreSQL database. You need to:

1. Install PostgreSQL 17 or later
2. Create a database named `micro_notes` (or use a custom name and configure it in environment variables)
   ```postgresql
   CREATE DATABASE micro_notes;
   CREATE USER micro_user WITH PASSWORD '<<password_here>>';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE micro_notes TO micro_user;
   ```
3. Set the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_HOST` - PostgreSQL host (default: localhost)
   - `DATABASE_PORT` - PostgreSQL port (default: 5432)
   - `DATABASE_NAME` - Database name (default: micro_notes)
   - `DATABASE_USER` - Database username
   - `DATABASE_PASS` - Database password

The application uses Flyway for database migrations, which will automatically create the necessary tables when the application starts.

## Running the Application

### Standard Run

```shell
mvn mn:run
```

The application will start on port 8080 by default. You can access the UI by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

### API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui

If you change the host or port, adjust the URLs accordingly.

### Docker Run

#### Using Micronaut Maven Plugin

```shell
# Build the Docker image
mvn clean package -Dpackaging=docker

# Run the Docker container
docker run -p 8080:8080 micronaut-micro-service
```

#### Using Docker Compose

This project includes a Docker Compose setup that runs both the application and a PostgreSQL database.

The project uses a `.env` file to store environment variables for Docker Compose, including database credentials. This approach prevents sensitive information from being hardcoded in the docker-compose.yml file.

```shell
# Build and start the containers
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the containers
docker-compose down

# Stop the containers and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v
```

The Docker Compose setup includes:
- The application running on port 8080
- PostgreSQL 17.6 with Alpine 3.22 running on port 5432
- Prometheus for metrics monitoring on port 9090
- Jaeger for distributed tracing on port 16686 (UI) and 4318 (OTLP)
- Health checks for both services
- Volume for PostgreSQL data persistence
- Environment variables loaded from `.env` file

##### Environment Variables

The `.env` file contains the following variables:
- `DATABASE_HOST`: PostgreSQL host (set to "postgres" for Docker Compose)
- `DATABASE_PORT`: PostgreSQL port
- `DATABASE_NAME`: Database name
- `DATABASE_USER`: Database username
- `DATABASE_PASS`: Database password
- `POSTGRES_DB`: PostgreSQL database name
- `POSTGRES_USER`: PostgreSQL username
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: PostgreSQL password

You can modify these variables in the `.env` file to customize your setup.

## Monitoring and Observability

When running the application with Docker Compose, you have access to monitoring and observability tools:

### Jaeger (Distributed Tracing)

Jaeger UI is accessible at:
```
http://localhost:16686
```

Here you can:
- View distributed traces of HTTP requests through the application
- Analyze request latency and performance bottlenecks
- Search and filter traces by service, operation, tags, and duration
- Visualize the flow of requests across different components

The application sends trace data to Jaeger using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) over HTTP on port 4318.

### Prometheus (Metrics Monitoring)

Prometheus UI is accessible at:
```
http://localhost:9090
```

Here you can:
- Query application metrics using PromQL
- View time-series data for JVM metrics, HTTP requests, and custom application metrics
- Create graphs and dashboards
- Monitor resource usage and application performance

The application exposes metrics at the `/prometheus` endpoint, which Prometheus scrapes every 15 seconds.

### How Distributed Tracing Works

The application uses a hierarchical span architecture for distributed tracing:

#### Automatic HTTP Instrumentation (Root Spans)

The `micronaut-tracing-opentelemetry-http` dependency provides automatic HTTP instrumentation without requiring any annotations on controllers. This library includes HTTP filters that:

- Automatically intercept all incoming HTTP requests
- Create a root span for each request at the controller entry point
- Extract trace context from incoming HTTP headers (for distributed tracing across services)
- Inject trace context into outgoing HTTP headers
- Capture HTTP-specific metadata (method, URL, status code, etc.)

This means that every REST API endpoint (like `GET /v1/notes` or `POST /v1/tags`) automatically gets a root span created without any explicit code or annotations in the controller classes.

#### Service Layer Spans (Child Spans)

While HTTP instrumentation handles the entry points automatically, the `@NewSpan` annotation is used on service methods to create child spans that provide detailed visibility into the service layer:

- Each `@NewSpan` annotation creates a child span linked to its parent (the HTTP request span)
- These child spans help track performance of individual business operations
- Custom span names (e.g., `"note-service-create"`, `"tag-service-get"`) make it easy to identify operations in Jaeger

**Example trace hierarchy:**
```
HTTP GET /v1/notes/1          (root span - automatic)
  â””â”€ note-service-get          (child span - @NewSpan annotation)
```

This architecture follows OpenTelemetry best practices: automatic instrumentation at integration points (HTTP) combined with manual instrumentation at business logic boundaries (service methods).

## Using the Notes and Tags UI

The UI provides a simple interface for managing your notes and tags. The interface is divided into two main sections:

- **Notes Section**: For creating, viewing, editing, and deleting notes
- **Tags Section**: For creating, viewing, editing, and deleting tags

There's also a tag management panel that appears when you click "Manage Tags" on a note, allowing you to associate tags with notes.

### Working with Notes

1. **View Notes**: All your notes are displayed in the Notes section.
2. **Create a Note**: 
   - Fill in the title and content in the "Add/Edit Note" form
   - Click "Save"
3. **Edit a Note**:
   - Click the "Edit" button on a note
   - Update the title and/or content
   - Click "Save"
4. **Delete a Note**:
   - Click the "Delete" button on a note
   - Confirm the deletion

### Working with Tags

1. **View Tags**: All your tags are displayed in the Tags section.
2. **Create a Tag**:
   - Enter a label in the "Add/Edit Tag" form
   - Click "Save"
3. **Edit a Tag**:
   - Click the "Edit" button on a tag
   - Update the label
   - Click "Save"
4. **Delete a Tag**:
   - Click the "Delete" button on a tag
   - Confirm the deletion

### Managing Tags for Notes

1. Click the "Manage Tags" button on a note
2. In the tag management panel:
   - Click on an available tag to add it to the note
   - Click on a selected tag to remove it from the note
3. Click "Close" when finished

## API Endpoints

### Notes API

- `GET /v1/notes` - Get all notes
- `GET /v1/notes/{id}` - Get a specific note
- `POST /v1/notes` - Create a new note
- `PATCH /v1/notes/{id}` - Update a note
- `DELETE /v1/notes/{id}` - Delete a note
- `POST /v1/notes/{noteId}/tags/{tagId}` - Add a tag to a note
- `DELETE /v1/notes/{noteId}/tags/{tagId}` - Remove a tag from a note

### Tags API

- `GET /v1/tags` - Get all tags
- `GET /v1/tags/{id}` - Get a specific tag
- `POST /v1/tags` - Create a new tag
- `PATCH /v1/tags/{id}` - Update a tag
- `DELETE /v1/tags/{id}` - Delete a tag

### Health API

- `GET /health` - Get application health status
  - Returns a JSON object with the following structure:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "UP",
      "timestamp": 1234567890123,
      "database": {
        "status": "UP"
      }
    }
    ```
  - If the database is down, the response will include an error message and the overall status will be "DOWN"
